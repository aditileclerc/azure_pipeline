# Azure Pipeline Automation
This repository contains the configuration files and scripts required to set up and manage an Azure DevOps Pipeline. The project demonstrates continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows for building, testing, and deploying applications using Azure DevOps.

**Project Overview**

The Azure Pipeline Automation project simplifies and automates the following tasks:

- Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically building and testing code changes.
- Continuous Delivery (CD): Deploying applications to staging or production environments.
- Artifact Management: Storing build outputs for future deployments.
- Infrastructure Provisioning: Optional integration with Azure Resource Manager (ARM) or Terraform.
  
**Features**
- Integration with Azure Repos for version control.
- YAML-based pipeline configuration for flexibility and scalability.
- Support for multiple environments: development, staging, and production.
- Automated build and deployment for containerized and traditional applications.
- Notifications for pipeline status via email or integrated tools like Microsoft Teams.

**Prerequisites**

Before setting up the pipeline, ensure you have:

- Azure DevOps Account: Access to an Azure DevOps organization.
- Azure CLI: Installed and authenticated on your local machine.
- Code Repository: Code pushed to an Azure DevOps Repo or GitHub repository.
- Service Connections: Configured for Azure subscriptions or container registries.
